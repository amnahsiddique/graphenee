Introduction to Graphenee
====================================

“Graphennee” is an open source framework for  developing rich Enterprise Applications. The name of the framework is a combination of Graphene and Enterprise Edition (ee). The development of this framework was started in April 2016 using Java, Spring Boot, and Vaadin.

The main purpose of developing the framework is to increase the coding efficiency for building attractive and user friendly enterprise applications for business and organizations.

It enables you to design login forms, dashboards, menus which helps to construct and develop user friendly applications. It provides you a base to design your application, Moreover you can customize themes and designs according to the specific structure of your application.

==================

**gx-security & gx-security-vaadin** 

gx-security contains pre-written utility classes which help to manage the systematic security. gx-security vaadin helps to define security implementations to your project. You can set up security procedures such as user authorization, privacy policies, access keys for your system.
